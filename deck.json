                "ELI5: How can you lose an entire limb and survive, but sever a single blood vessel in your limb and bleed to death in seconds?",
                "<div><div><div>Having a limb severed causes the arteries and veins to retract into the body (shunting), allowing the compression of whatever body part they retract into to slow the bleeding down. Having a sliced artery in place allows free flow of large amounts of blood.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div>First, this depends on the vessel size and where it is. If a large blood vessel in your chest, like your aorta, were to rupture it can leak a lot more blood in less time than a number of smaller vessels in your limbs put together. Second, your body has the ability to “shunt” blood from the outer parts of your body to your core to save the most vital parts of you. When you cut off a limb, if it is relatively clean, the vessels themselves will constrict to help slow down blood loss and the body will use that “shunting” ability to slow down blood movement to your extremities, keeping blood for your heart and brain. This shunting ability is also the reason why most bicyclist and motorcyclists quickly come to know that the warmest gloves in the world will not keep your hands warm and nimble, unless your core is also warm. The body will always redirect blood flow from your hands to keep your core warm, unless those body parts are addressed first. Lastly blood loss from your extremites is more likely to be quickly detected and controlled. Internal blood loss from a vessel can go on for awhile before producing shock and any physical signs. In fact, most of the signs will be fairly general. When my wife’s appendix burst, she initially reported general abdominal pain and a feeling of uneasiness. Obviously, if her arm had been missing she would have called for an ambulance a lot sooner. Most of the bruising that appears from an internal rupture is considered a late sign of internal bleeding.<br></div>",

Trouble falling asleep is the most normal effect of quitting, and can be a real bitch. Also the appetite can really take a hit and this might last for weeks before feeling normal again, but then it's often better than when smoking every day. As mentioned, you also start dreaming pretty heavily as you don't dream when smoking. Sweaty hands and sweating while sleeping is also normal. I've had all these symptoms when quitting, but have also experienced way less other times I quit. It's individual, but I find it really weird I'm the first one to say there are effects, while other comments claim there are none. If there were none there wouldn't be so many stoners.",

I don’t know if this will change now that the US CDC has changed its recommendation, now advising people to wear a mask.</div><div>My question is not so much on the legality of employers firing (or threatening to fire) people for wearing a mask... but rather on the \"<strong>why</strong>\". Why would anyone forbid people from using life-saving protection amidst a pandemic???</div><div>From the reality I’m used to (Asia), the opposite would be normal: employees fired or more likely forbid from going to work if not wearing a mask.</div>So, what’s up with employers in the US?? Is it just blind and extreme political partisanship? Or some other reason?<div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Answer: since the US doesn't have a culture of preventative mask wearing, employees with masks may be seen as potentially sick (since masks are associated with already sick people).

The reproduction of most animals is closely tied to the availability of food because reproducing is very resource-intensive for the parent and the young also need food.</div><div><br></div><div>So, in the case of whales, they're not instinctively driven to certain areas. They're instinctively driven to reproduce when they get the chance to glut on food. For orca's, that's when other whales, seals, penguins, fish etc. start to reproduce. Which in turn is often when the food for those animals start to reproduce.</div><div><br></div><div>Orcas tend to be very habitual. Different pods specialise in hunting different food sources. A pod can be traditional whale hunters, seal hunters or fish eaters despite all orca's being the same species. As such, they all share the instinct to reproduce when food is plentiful but where that is varies and is learned behaviour that young orcas pick up from their parents.</div>",

                "The full answer is pretty complicated, but the short version is that <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">plants have hormones just like animals</span>. They have growth hormones and the <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">ability to sense light and the direction of gravity</span>. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">Most plants try to grow towards light and against gravity</span>. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">Many plants also grow more in the summer because they sense that the days are longer</span>. There have been experiments done with plants kept in similar environments but with different durations of light, and it was found that you can cause certain plants to bloom depending on how long the lights are on.<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div>There's also the peculiar case of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allyouneedisbiology.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/crown-shyness-trees/\" style=\"\">Crown Shyness</a>&nbsp;where the canopy of trees will not touch. It creates really beautiful patterns when you look up.</div><div>Secondly, some people use knowledge of tree growth to shape the trees.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/gavin-munro-full-grown-tree-furniture/\">Tree Furniture</a>&nbsp;is another fascinating way to modify growth.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>To complete and go more in depth on what was already answered, <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">it is a mix of influences from genetics and environmental conditions</span> (as for everything in biology actually). A <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">stem or a branch usually end with a bud (called apical bud) which contain a special group of cells called a meristem</span>. Meristems are <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">where cell multiplication happens</span> in a plant and so are <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">what allow a plant to grow</span>. During the growth season, this apical meristem will produce new cells at the base of the bud and those cells will then elongate, which will make the branch grow longer. As others said, <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">this process is controlled by hormones</span> (the principal one being called the auxin), and <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">those hormones are strongly sensitive to the environmental conditions</span>. For example, <span style=\"background-color: rgb(215, 243, 255);\">light destroy the auxin, which will make the shadowed side of a stem grow more than the other side and the stem will \"go\" toward the light source</span>. Every now and then during this period, the meristem will produce a leaf and on the top of the junction between the leaf and the branch, a little piece of meristem will separate to create a new bud (called axillary bud). This bud will stay dormant until the next growing season (where there is different seasons) and then it will start to be active the same way as the apical bud (it actually is an apical bud at this point) and develop into a new branch. The rhythm and the places the leaves and the axillary buds will be produce is mainly controlled by genetics. So to summarize, environmental conditions like light (but also wind, gravity, animal grazing,...) control the shape of the branches and where they go, and genetics controls when and where a new branch is produced.<br></div>",

And it has unusual features that have only recently been identified in scaly anteaters called pangolins, evidence that the virus came from nature, Kristian Andersen and his colleagues report March 17 <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">in&nbsp;<em style=\"\">Nature Medicine</em></span>.</div><div><br></div><div>When Andersen, an infectious disease researcher at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., first heard about the coronavirus causing an outbreak in China, he wondered where the virus came from. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">Initially, researchers thought the virus was being spread by repeated infections jumping from animals in a seafood market in Wuhan, China, into humans and then being passed person to person</span>. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">Analysis from other researchers has since suggested that the virus probably&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread\" style=\"\">jumped only once from an animal into a person</a>&nbsp;and has been spread human to human</span> since about mid-November (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>).</div><div><br></div><div>But shortly after the virus’s genetic makeup was revealed in early January, <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">rumors began bubbling up that maybe the virus was engineered in a lab and either intentionally or accidentally released.</span></div><div><div></div></div><div><br></div><div>An <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">unfortunate coincidence fueled conspiracy theorists</span>, says Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University in New Orleans. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">The Wuhan Institute of Virology is “in very close proximity to” the seafood market</span>, <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">and has conducted research on viruses, including coronaviruses, found in bats that have potential to cause disease in people</span>. “That led people to think that, oh, it escaped and went down the sewers, or somebody walked out of their lab and went over to the market or something,” Garry says.</div><div><br></div><div>Accidental releases of viruses, including SARS, have happened from other labs in the past. So “this is not something you can just dismiss out of hand,” Andersen says. “That would be foolish.”</div><div><br></div><b>Looking for clues</b><div>Andersen assembled a team of evolutionary biologists and virologists, including Garry, from several countries to analyze the virus for clues that it could have been human-made, or grown in and accidentally released from a lab.</div><div><br></div><div>“We said, ‘Let’s take this theory — of which there are multiple different versions — that the virus has a non-natural origin … as a serious potential hypothesis,’ ” Andersen says.</div><div><br></div><div>Meeting via Slack and other virtual portals, the researchers analyzed the virus’s genetic makeup, or RNA sequence, for clues about its origin.</div><div><br></div><div>It was clear “almost overnight” that the virus wasn’t human-made, Andersen says. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">Anyone hoping to create a virus would need to work with already known viruses and engineer them to have desired properties.</span></div><div><br></div><div>But <span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">the SARS-CoV-2 virus has components that differ from those of previously known viruses, so they had to come from an unknown virus or viruses in nature</span>. “Genetic data irrefutably show that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">SARS-CoV-2 is not derived</a>&nbsp;from any previously used virus backbone,” Andersen and colleagues write in the study.</div><div><br></div><div>“<span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">This is not a virus somebody would have conceived of and cobbled together. It has too many distinct features, some of which are counterintuitive,” Garry says. “You wouldn’t do this if you were trying to make a more deadly virus</span>.”</div><div><br>That finding debunks a widely disputed analysis, posted at bioRxiv.org before peer review, that claimed to find bits of HIV in the coronavirus, Hodcroft says. Other scientists quickly pointed out flaws in the study and the authors retracted the report, but not before it fueled the notion that the virus was engineered.Other scientists agree. “We see absolutely no evidence that the virus has been engineered or purposely released,” says Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. She was not part of Andersen’s group, but is a member of a team of scientists with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nextstrain.org/\">Nextstrain.org</a>&nbsp;that is tracking small genetic changes in the coronavirus to learn more about how it is spreading around the world.<br></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">Some stretches of the virus’s genetic material are similar to HIV, but that’s something that stems from those viruses sharing a common ancestor during evolution</span>, Hodcroft says. “<span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">Essentially their claim was the same as me taking a copy of the<em style=\"\">&nbsp;Odyssey</em>&nbsp;and saying, ‘Oh, this has the word&nbsp;<em style=\"\">the</em>&nbsp;in it,’ and then opening another book, seeing the word&nbsp;<em style=\"\">the</em>&nbsp;in it and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s the same word, there must be parts of the&nbsp;<em style=\"\">Odyssey</em>&nbsp;in this other book,”</span> she says. “It was a really misleading claim and really bad science.”</div><div><br></div><b>Finding peculiar features</b><div>Andersen’s group next set out to determine whether the virus could have been accidentally released from a lab. That’s a real possibility because researchers in many places are working with coronaviruses that have potential to infect humans, he says. “Stuff comes out of the lab sometimes, almost always accidentally,” he says.</div><div><br></div><div>A couple of unexpected features of the virus caught the researchers’ eyes, Andersen says. In particular, the gene encoding the coronavirus’s spike protein has 12 extra RNA building blocks, or nucleotides, stuck in it.</div><div><br></div><div>This spike protein protrudes from the virus’ surface and allows the virus to latch onto and enter human cells. That insertion of RNA building blocks adds four amino acids to the spike protein, and creates a site in the protein for an enzyme called furin to cut. Furin is made in human cells, and cleaves proteins only at spots where a particular combination of amino acids is found, like the one created by the insertion. SARS and other SARS-like viruses don’t have those cutting sites.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Finding the furin cutting site was a surprise: “That was an aha moment and an uh-oh moment,” Garry says. When bird influenza viruses acquire the ability to be cut by furin, the viruses often become more easily transmissible. The insertion also created places where sugar molecules could be fastened to the spike protein, creating a shield to protect the virus from the immune system.</div><div><br></div><div>The COVID-19 virus’ spike protein also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-repurposed-treatments-drugs\">binds more tightly</a>&nbsp;to a protein on human cells called ACE2 than SARS does (<em>SN: 3/10/20</em>). Tighter binding may allow SARS-CoV-2 to more easily infect cells. Together, those features may account for why COVID-19 is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms\">so contagious</a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</div><div><br></div><div>“It’s very peculiar, these two features,” Andersen says. “How do we explain how this came about? &nbsp;I’ve got to be honest. I was skeptical [that it was natural]. This could have happened in tissue culture” in a lab, where viruses may acquire mutations as they replicate many times in lab dishes. In nature, viruses carrying some of those mutations might be weeded out by natural selection but might persist in lab dishes where even feeble viruses don’t have to fight hard for survival.</div><div><br></div><b>Clinching the case for nature</b><div>But then the researchers compared SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses recently found in nature, including in bats and pangolins. “<span style=\"background-color: rgb(185, 234, 255);\">It looks like SARS-CoV-2 could be a mix of bat and pangolin viruses</span>,” Garry says.</div><div><br></div><div>Viruses, especially RNA viruses such as coronaviruses, often swap genes in nature. Finding genes related to the pangolin viruses was especially reassuring because those viruses’ genetic makeup wasn’t known until after SARS-CoV-2’s discovery, making it unlikely anyone was working with them in a lab, he says.</div><img src=\"031920_ts_covid-conspiracies_inline_680.jpg\" class=\"\"><div><div>In particular, pangolins also have the amino acids that cause the tight binding of the spike protein to ACE2, the team found. “So clearly, this is something that can happen in nature,” Andersen says. “I thought that was very important little clue. It shows there’s no mystery about its tighter binding to the human [protein] because pangolins do it, too.”</div><div><br></div><div>The sugar-attachment sites were another clue that the virus is natural, Andersen says. The sugars create a “mucin shield” that protects the virus from an immune system attack. But lab tissue culture dishes don’t have immune systems, making it unlikely that such an adaptation would arise from growing the virus in a lab. “That sort of explained away the tissue-culture hypothesis,” he says.</div><div><br></div><div>Similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat and pangolin viruses is some of the best evidence that the virus is natural, Hodcroft says. “This was just another animal spillover into humans,” she says. “It’s really the most simple explanation for what we see.” Researchers still aren’t sure exactly which animal was the source.</div><div><br></div><div>Andersen says the analysis probably won’t lay conspiracy theories to rest. Still, he thinks the analysis was worth doing. “I was myself skeptical at the beginning and I kept flipping back and forth,” Andersen says, but he’s now convinced. “All the data show it’s natural.”</div></div>",
